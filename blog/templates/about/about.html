							<h2>Taekwondo</h2>
								<p2>Having started taekwondo in 2010, I have progressed over the years through rigorous training and long hours to achieve my black belt in 2014. 
									Despite taking breaks from training due to exams, I continued to train and am now an avid member of Ki-Taekwondo at the University of Birmingham. 
									Learning a new style of taekwondo, I am determined to progress further and overcome the new aspects I now face.

							<h2>Lakeside Community School</h2>
								<p2>A group of 11 and I went to Lakeside to help underprivileged kids of age 7-9, with schoolwork as well as planning and running classes
								independently. It involves a lot of time planning and getting resources for lessons. I have learned many teaching techniques and how do deal
								with different problems that can occur. This has also taught me to be more open minded and understanding of people in different situations
								as well as knowing how to help people with specific problems.</p2>

							<h2>Leading the Computer Science Gifted and Talented Club</h2>
								<p2>Being in a group of 3, we manage and teach kids from the lower years about programming by teaching a programming language (Python) and
								creating program challenges. We also entered some of the kids into a coding challenge, 4 of which achieved an exceptional score. This
								involves a lot of planning for the class as well as understanding each child's different ability and way of learning to find the best way to teach.
								I have learnt about teaching methods as well as cementing my own knowledge of Python.</p2>

							<h2>Designing for TEDx Talk</h2>
								<p2>I was a member of the Graphics Design team for the TEDx talk at Tanglin Trust School. This involved creating and executing ideas for logos and banners based on the theme of the domino effect. It required a large amount of time and planning with others as well as learning how to use new software.</p2>

							<h2>National Youth Achievement Award</h2>
								<p2>Over the course of the two years, I was able to help the community around me as well as improve and learn new skills. The NYAA helped me build character and allowed me to interact with people across the country to help improve lives.</p2>

							<h2>Self-taught Acoustic Guitar </h2>
								<p2>Guitar was the skill that I taught myself. Before I started to learn how to play the acoustic guitar, I set myself an objective to become confident and able to coherently play different pieces of music. I also set myself the objective of teaching myself and learning independently with the aid of online resources. </p2>

							<h2>Expedia</h2>
								<p2>I worked closely with the Data Science team in cleaning, analysing and producing a presentation based on data from several companies on their travel expenses. I learnt how to handle large databases and spreadsheets as well as organising structured and unstructured data. I also	constructed a presentation aimed at the CFO’s of all the companies explaining my findings and subsequent actions that should be taken. Whilst at Egencia, I took the time to plan meetings with various employees from different areas in the company to get a wider understanding of what different roles entail and the steps to get there. One of the key skills I developed was time management, working towards a deadline along with planning external meetings. Communication was essential in collaborating, managing and most importantly asking for help, not only within the office but also on video conferences and emails.</p2>

							<h2>Quantum Computing Lecture</h2>
								<p2>I delivered a lecture to over 40 students on how quantum computing works and application in real life joint with encryption. As I was not an
								expert on the subject, I had to do a lot of research by reading several journals, articles, websites and listened to several talks from experts in
								the field. It involved a lot of preparation in making an interactive presentation and being able to articulate ideas across so that the audience
								were able to understand.</p2>

							<h2>Himalyan Health Project</h2>
								<p2>
									Over the course of a week, working from 8 am to 6 pm. I was based in Mahabodhi Hospital, Leh, Ladakh as a voluntary dentist assistant and
									coordinator.
									Being based in the dentistry sector, my main responsibility was to make sure that the patients moved through check-ups,
									scaling/cleaning, and surgery efficiently. The language barrier, a patient’s unique aural problems, and managing appointments were the main
									issues we faced. Being able to communicate in Hindi, I helped translate and crossed the language barrier. I also applied my knowledge of
									computing and physics to fix lots of equipment. My job was to aid the main dentist with scribing as she carried out the check-ups. I was pro-
									active and thought ahead by planning appointments based on what I was scribing so that we saved time. I also assisted another dentist with
									scaling and cleaning which was a new experience. I shadowed another doctor in the surgery which involved me preparing and equipment and
									dental instruments. I learned how to deal with a large amount of stress in different situations as well as understanding a lot about oral
									hygiene.</p2>

							<h2>Organised Beach Clean Up</h2>
								<p2>After our expedition in Hong Kong, our team took the initiative to share the awareness of pollution to the wider community by hosting and organising a beach clean up in Singapore. This allowed us to teach a wider audience from different backgrounds and ages our effect on the environment.</p2>

							<h2>Independant Expedition in Hong Kong</h2>
								<p2>As part of my NYAA (Duke of Edenborough award), my team of 3 and I planned a trip to the New Territories in Hong Kong. Only using a
								compass and a map, we navigated through the Maclehose trail carrying a week’s supply of food and equipment. I learnt about independence,
								having to manage by myself for the week and co-operation, as our team had an objective which we needed to work together to achieve. Our
								objective was to survey the level of pollution in different areas, we then acted upon this by planning a beach clean-up in Singapore.</p2>

							<h2>Rugby 7's</h2>
								<p2>I was part of the school's rugby team. We won the ACSIS tournament in division 1 playing against the top teams in Singapore. We had to train
								twice a week, early mornings and after school. I learnt about teamwork as we had to all work together, resilience through intense training
								and I gained a real passion for the sport. Being new to the sport, I had to learn about all the rules and structure of the game which took
								perseverance but, it paid off afterwards as I scored 6 try's in the season.</p2>

							<p2>Despite being 3 years younger than members of the team, I captained the under 17's team through the year. I previously played for another team so I had to transition and learn a different style of play with the team that was there. I quickly fit in and soon after, started captaining my teammates.</p2>

							<h2>Barclays Bank</h2>
								<p2>I was based across two teams, Technology Development and Technology Risk.</p2>
								<br></br>
								<p2>
								<b>Technology Development:</b> As part of the software development team, which at the time was focusing on the launch of their new product
								(mobile banking platform), I learnt various skills. These skills included how to plan and approach project and task management, Agile
								development techniques and experienced a life in the day of a programmer across different teams. I took the opportunity to understand how
								micro-teams work together to create a product in addition to the organisational structure of the Technology Department in a large financial
								institution.
								</p2>
								<br></br>
								<p2>
								<b>Technology Risk:</b> I took part in the risk management process which involved the ongoing management of identified risk such as data leakage. I
								was able to understand the process the Bank follows to reduce its risk as well being involved in an exercise to identify risk. From this experience
								I was able to further understand the chronological sequence of operations that occur in and outside of the bank.</p2>
